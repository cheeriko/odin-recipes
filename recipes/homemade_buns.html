  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>An excellent yeast bun recipe that can be used for hamburgers or just plain dinner rolls. They don't take long to make and have never failed for me!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 cups all-purpose flour, divided, or more as needed</li>
    <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 cup milk</li>
    <li>¾ cup water</li>
    <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
    <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Stir 2 cups flour and yeast together in a large bowl. Heat milk, water, oil, sugar, and salt together in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until lukewarm; add to flour mixture and beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix in 2 cups remaining flour, then add up to 1 cup more flour as necessary to make a soft dough. Dust a flat surface with flour; turn dough out onto floured surface and let rest under a bowl for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, lightly grease a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Shape dough into 12 slightly flat balls and place on the prepared baking sheet to rise until doubled in size.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
